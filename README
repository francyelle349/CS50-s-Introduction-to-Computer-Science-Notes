I am currently taking the CS50 course from Harvard on the basics of computer science and reviewing it. Feel free to download and study the materials! I hope these notes help you learn more about computer science concepts and how computers work in general.

The notes are organized by each class:

-Week 0 notes
-Week 1 notes
